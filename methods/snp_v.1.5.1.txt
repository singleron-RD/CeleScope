Raw reads were processed using CeleScope v1.5.1(https://github.com/singleron-RD/CeleScope/tree/v1.5.1). Briefly, Barcodes and UMIs were extracted from R1 reads and corrected. Adapter sequences and poly A tails were trimmed from R2 reads and the trimmed R2 reads were aligned against the GRCh38 transcriptome using STAR(v2.6.1b). Then, Bcftools is used for variant calling, with default parameters. We borrowed the method in the Viral-Track to filter the background contamination. For each variant, we used the Otsu method to determine the support reads threshold T. If the number of supported reads for the variant in a cell is less than T, it was set to zero.
