The CeleScope(v2.7.3; [https://github.com/singleron-RD/CeleScope](https://github.com/singleron-RD/CeleScope)) analysis pipeline was employed for initial processing of scRNA-seq data. Raw sequencing reads underwent demultiplexing and were mapped to the Ensembl release 110 human reference genome. Alignment and gene-level quantification were implemented through STARsolo (v2.7.11b; https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/master/docs/STARsolo.md) to produce the gene expression matrix.
