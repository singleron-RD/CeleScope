Tag Assignment Algorithm

There are three states for each cell:
    - Undetermined: cells that have not been stained with any tag.
    - Multiplet: cells that are not Undetermined and stained with more than one tag.
    - Singlet: cells that are neither Undetermined nor Multiplet.

Undetermined cells: cells with tag UMI count < UMI_min. UMI_min is calculated as max(min(5 percentile of UMI counts of all cells, median of UMI counts of all cells / 10), 1)

Multiplet cells: cells with SNR(signal-to-noise-ratio) < SNR_min. SNR_min is calculated with the following algorithm:
    1. Calulate SNR of all cells. SNR = maximum tag UMI count / second maximum tag UMI count.
    2. If median of all cells SNR is infinite, set SNR_min = 10.
    3. If not, SNR_min is calculated as the maximum of (median of all cells SNR * 0.1, 2)
