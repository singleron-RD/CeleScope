## Features

- Demultiplex barcodes.
- Filter invalid R1 reads, which includes:
    - Reads without linker: the mismatch between linkers and all linkers in the whitelist is greater than 2.  
    - Reads without correct barcode: the mismatch between barcodes and all barcodes in the whitelist is greater than 1.  
    - Reads without polyT: the number of T bases in the defined polyT region is less than 10.
    - Low quality reads: low sequencing quality in barcode and UMI regions.

## Output

- `01.barcode/{sample}_2.fq(.gz)` Demultiplexed R2 reads. Barcode and UMI are contained in the read name. The format of 
the read name is `{barcode}_{UMI}_{read ID}`.
## Arguments
`--chemistry` Predefined (pattern, barcode whitelist, linker whitelist) combinations. Can be one of:  
- `auto` Default value. Used for Singleron GEXSCOPE libraries >= scopeV2 and automatically detects the combinations.  
- `scopeV1` Used for legacy Singleron GEXSCOPE scopeV1 libraries.  
- `customized` Used for user defined combinations. You need to provide `pattern`, `whitelist` and `linker` at the 
same time.

`--pattern` The pattern of R1 reads, e.g. `C8L16C8L16C8L1U12T18`. The number after the letter represents the number 
        of bases.  
- `C`: cell barcode  
- `L`: linker(common sequences)  
- `U`: UMI    
- `T`: poly T.

`--whitelist` Cell barcode whitelist file path, one cell barcode per line.

`--linker` Linker whitelist file path, one linker per line.

`--lowQual` Default 0. Bases in cell barcode and UMI whose phred value are lower than lowQual will be regarded as low-quality bases.

`--lowNum` The maximum allowed lowQual bases in cell barcode and UMI.

`--nopolyT` Outputs R1 reads without polyT.

`--noLinker` Outputs R1 reads without correct linker.

`--allowNoPolyT` Allow valid reads without polyT.

`--allowNoLinker` Allow valid reads without correct linker.

`--gzip` Output gzipped fastq files.

`--output_R1` Output valid R1 reads.

`--fq1` R1 fastq file. Multiple files are separated by comma.

`--fq2` R2 fastq file. Multiple files are separated by comma.

`--outdir` Output diretory.

`--sample` Sample name.

`--thread` Thread to use.

`--debug` If this argument is used, celescope may output addtional file for debugging.
