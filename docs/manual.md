## Introduction
CeleScope is a collection of bioinfomatics analysis pipelines to process single cell sequencing data generated with Singleron products. These pipelines take paired-end FASTQ files as input and generate output files which can be used for downstream data analysis as well as a summary of QC criteria.

Each pipeline consists of several steps and they all have two identical pre-processing steps: `barcode` and `cutadapt`. `barcode`step is used for barcode demupltiplexing, correction and read filtering. `cutadapt` step calls [Cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for read trimming.

Currently, CeleScope includes the follwing pipelines:

- `celescope rna` for Single-cell RNA-seq data generated with GEXSCOPE<sup>TM</sup> kits. It performs preprocessing, genome alignment, feature counting, expression matrix generation, clustering, marker gene expression analysis and cell type assignment(optional).

- `celescope vdj` for Single-cell Immune Repertoire data generated with GEXSCOPE<sup>TM</sup> IR kits. It performs preprocessing, UMI consensus, vdj sequence alignment, UMI filtering and clonetypes counting.

- `celescope tag` for Single-cell Multiplexing data generated with CLindex<sup>TM</sup> Sample Multiplexing kits. It performs preprocessing, tag counting, tag assignment and multiplets identification.

- `celescope dynaseq` for Single cell dynamic transcriptome data generated with DynaSCOPE<sup>TM</sup> kits. It performs preprocessing, genome alignment, feature counting, expression matrix generation, clustering, nucleotide substitution statistic and nascent RNA identification.

- `celescope snp` for Single cell variant data generated with FocuSCOPE<sup>TM</sup> kits. It performs preprocessing, genome alignment, feature counting, variant calling, variant filtering and variant annotation.

- `celescope capture_virus` for Single cell Epstein-Barr virus(EBV) data generated with FocuSCOPE<sup>TM</sup> Single Cell mRNA Ã— EBV Library  kits. It performs preprocessing, genome alignment, UMI counting, filtering and analysis.

- `celescope fusion` for Single cell fusion detection. For example, it can be used to detect known fusion events in blood cancer. It performs preprocessing, fusion site alignment, UMI counting, filtering and analysis.

- `celescope flv_CR` for Single cell full Length TCR/BCR data generated sCircle<sup>TM</sup> Kits. It performs preprocessing, barcode conversion, assemble, annotation and filtering.

- `celescope flv_trust4` for Single cell full Length TCR/BCR data generated sCircle<sup>TM</sup> Kits. It performs preprocessing, mapping, assemble, annotation and filtering.
