## Usage

```
    multi_dynaseq\
    --mapfile ./rna.mapfile\
    --genomeDir /SGRNJ/Public/Database/genome/homo_mus\
    --strand /SGRNJ03/Public/Database/genome/gene.strandedness.csv

## Features
### barcode

- Demultiplex barcodes.
- Filter invalid R1 reads, which includes:
    - Reads without linker: the mismatch between linkers and all linkers in the whitelist is greater than 2.  
    - Reads without correct barcode: the mismatch between barcodes and all barcodes in the whitelist is greater than 1.  
    - Reads without polyT: the number of T bases in the defined polyT region is less than 10.
    - Low quality reads: low sequencing quality in barcode and UMI regions.


### cutadapt
- Trim adapters in R2 reads with cutadapt. Default adapters includes:
    - polyT=A{18}, 18 A bases. 
    - p5=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA, Illumina p5 adapter.

- Cell type annotation(optional). You can provide markers of known cell types and annotate cell types for each cluster.


### conversion
- Get conversion pos in each read.
    - Get snp info. 


### substitution

## Output files
### barcode

- `01.barcode/{sample}_2.fq(.gz)` Demultiplexed R2 reads. Barcode and UMI are contained in the read name. The format of 
the read name is `{barcode}_{UMI}_{read ID}`.

### cutadapt
- `cutadapt.log` Cutadapt output log file.
- `{sample}_clean_2.fq.gz` R2 reads file without adapters.

### star
- `{sample}_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam` BAM file contains Uniquely Mapped Reads.

- `{sample}_SJ.out.tab` SJ.out.tab contains high confidence collapsed splice junctions in tab-delimited format.

- `{sample}_Log.out` Main log with a lot of detailed information about the run. 
This is most useful for troubleshooting and debugging.

- `{sample}_Log.progress.out` Report job progress statistics, such as the number of processed reads, 
% of mapped reads etc. It is updated in 1 minute intervals.

- `{sample}_Log.Log.final.out` Summary mapping statistics after mapping job is complete, 
very useful for quality control. The statistics are calculated for each read (single- or paired-end) and 
then summed or averaged over all reads. Note that STAR counts a paired-end read as one read, 
(unlike the samtools agstat/idxstats, which count each mate separately). 
Most of the information is collected about the UNIQUE mappers 
(unlike samtools agstat/idxstats which does not separate unique or multi-mappers). 
Each splicing is counted in the numbers of splices, which would correspond to 
summing the counts in SJ.out.tab. The mismatch/indel error rates are calculated on a per base basis, 
i.e. as total number of mismatches/indels in all unique mappers divided by the total number of mapped bases.

### featureCounts
- `{sample}` Numbers of reads assigned to features (or meta-features).
- `{sample}_summary` Stat info for the overall summrization results, including number of 
successfully assigned reads and number of reads that failed to be assigned due to 
various reasons (these reasons are included in the stat info).
- `{sample}_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam.featureCounts.bam` featureCounts output BAM, 
sorted by coordinates;BAM file contains tags as following(Software Version>=1.1.8):
    - CB cell barcode
    - UB UMI
    - GN gene name
    - GX gene id
- `{sample}_name_sorted.bam` featureCounts output BAM, sorted by read name.

### count
- `{sample}_raw_feature_bc_matrix` The expression matrix of all detected barcodes in [Matrix Market Exchange Formats](
    https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html). 
- `{sample}_filtered_feature_bc_matrix` The expression matrix of cell barcodes in Matrix Market Exchange Formats.

    - read_count  
- `{sample}_counts.txt` 6 columns:
    - Barcode: barcode sequence

```

`--mod` Which type of script to generate, `sjm` or `shell`.

`--queue` Only works if the `--mod` selects `sjm`.

`--rm_files` Remove redundant fastq and bam files after running.

`--steps_run` Steps to run. Multiple Steps are separated by comma. For example, if you only want to run `barcode` and `cutadapt`, 
use `--steps_run barcode,cutadapt`.

`--outdir` Output directory.

`--thread` Thread to use.

`--debug` If this argument is used, celescope may output addtional file for debugging.

`--chemistry` Predefined (pattern, barcode whitelist, linker whitelist) combinations. `--chemistry auto` can auto-detect scopeV2 mRNA, scopeV3 mRNA, full length VDJ mRNA(flv_rna) and full length VDJ(flv). You need to explicitly use `--chemistry scopeV1` for legacy chemistry scopeV1. `--chemistry customized` is used for user defined combinations that you need to provide `--pattern`, `--whitelist` and `--linker` at the same time.

`--pattern` The pattern of R1 reads, e.g. `C8L16C8L16C8L1U12T18`. The number after the letter represents the number 
        of bases.  
- `C`: cell barcode  
- `L`: linker(common sequences)  
- `U`: UMI    
- `T`: poly T.

`--whitelist` Cell barcode whitelist file path, one cell barcode per line.

`--linker` Linker whitelist file path, one linker per line.

`--lowQual` Default 0. Bases in cell barcode and UMI whose phred value are lower than lowQual will be regarded as low-quality bases.

`--lowNum` The maximum allowed lowQual bases in cell barcode and UMI.

`--nopolyT` Outputs R1 reads without polyT.

`--noLinker` Outputs R1 reads without correct linker.

`--allowNoPolyT` Allow valid reads without polyT.

`--allowNoLinker` Allow valid reads without correct linker.

`--output_R1` Output valid R1 reads.

`--gzip` Output gzipped fastq files.

`--adapter_fasta` Addtional adapter fasta file.

`--minimum_length` Default `20`. Discard processed reads that are shorter than LENGTH.

`--nextseq_trim` Default `20`. Quality trimming of reads using two-color chemistry (NextSeq). 
Some Illumina instruments use a two-color chemistry to encode the four bases. 
This includes the NextSeq and the NovaSeq. 
In those instruments, a ‘dark cycle’ (with no detected color) encodes a G. 
However, dark cycles also occur when sequencing “falls off” the end of the fragment.
The read then contains a run of high-quality, but incorrect “G” calls at its 3’ end.

`--overlap` Default `10`. Since Cutadapt allows partial matches between the read and the adapter sequence,
short matches can occur by chance, leading to erroneously trimmed bases. 
For example, roughly 0.25 of all reads end with a base that is identical to the first base of the adapter. 
To reduce the number of falsely trimmed bases, the alignment algorithm requires that 
at least {overlap} bases match between adapter and read.

`--insert` Default `150`. Read2 insert length.

`--cutadapt_param` Other cutadapt parameters. For example, --cutadapt_param "-g AAA".

`--outFilterMatchNmin` Default `0`. Alignment will be output only if the number of matched bases 
is higher than or equal to this value.

`--out_unmapped` Output unmapped reads.

`--STAR_param` Additional parameters for the called software. Need to be enclosed in quotation marks. For example, `--{software}_param "--param1 value1 --param2 value2"`.

`--outFilterMultimapNmax` Default `1`. How many places are allowed to match a read at most.

`--starMem` Default `30`. Maximum memory that STAR can use.

`--gtf_type` Specify feature type in GTF annotation.

`--featureCounts_param` Additional parameters for the called software. Need to be enclosed in quotation marks. For example, `--{software}_param "--param1 value1 --param2 value2"`.

`--expected_cell_num` Default `3000`. Expected cell number.

`--cell_calling_method` Default `EmptyDrops_CR`. Choose from [`auto`, `EmptyDrops_CR`].

`--genomeDir` Required. Genome directory after running `celescope {assay} mkref`.

`--strand` gene strand file, the format is "geneID,+/-".

`--bg_cov` background snp depth filter, lower than bg_cov will be discarded. Only valid in csv format.

`--snp_threshold` snp threshold filter, greater than snp_threshold will be recognized as snp. Only valid in csv format.
