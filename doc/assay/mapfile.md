Mapfile is a tab-delimited text file with as least three columns. Each line of mapfile represents paired-end fastq files.

1st column: Fastq file prefix.  
2nd column: Fastq file directory path.  
3rd column: Sample name, which is the prefix of all output files.  
4th column: The 4th column has different meaning for each assay. The single cell rna directory after running CeleScope is called `matched_dir`.

- `rna` Optional, forced cell number.
- `vdj` Required, matched_dir.
- `tag` Required, matched_dir.
- `dynaseq` Optional, forced cell number.
- `snp` Required, matched_dir.
- `capture_virus` Required, matched_dir.
- `fusion` Required, matched_dir.
- `citeseq` Required, matched_dir.
- `flv_trust4` Required, matched_dir.
- `sweetseq` Required, matched_dir.
 
5th column:
- `dynaseq` Required, background snp file.

Example

Sample1 has 2 paired-end fastq files located in 2 different directories(fastq_dir1 and fastq_dir2). Sample2 has 1 paired-end fastq file located in fastq_dir1.
```
$cat ./my.mapfile
fastq_prefix1	fastq_dir1	sample1
fastq_prefix2	fastq_dir2	sample1
fastq_prefix3	fastq_dir1	sample2

$ls fastq_dir1
fastq_prefix1_1.fq.gz	fastq_prefix1_2.fq.gz
fastq_prefix3_1.fq.gz	fastq_prefix3_2.fq.gz

$ls fastq_dir2
fastq_prefix2_1.fq.gz	fastq_prefix2_2.fq.gz
```
